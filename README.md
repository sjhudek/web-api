# User Story

As an aspiring developer enrolled in a coding boot camp, I need to create a timed quiz that is based on JavaScript fundamentals. This  is essential in helping me track my progress. I am confident that this will contribute to my learning experience and improve my coding skills.

# Acceptance Criteria
* When the user clicks the start button, a timer starts ticking and a question pops up. 
* If a question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.
* The game ends when all the questions have been answered  or the timer reaches zero. 
* Then the user can save their initials and score.
